question 1
em is size relative to parent, while rem is size relative to Root.

question 5.g.i
I notice no difference

question 6
the span#content p#aboutus is of higher specificity, so it will be the one applied.

question 7
what happened, is the style of p#aboutus changed to red, because the importatn directives tells the browser that this statement should be applied even if a selector with higher specificity should be able to override it
